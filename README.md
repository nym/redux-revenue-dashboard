# React / Redux Revenue Dashboard

This is a sample project that I built to learn Redux. It allows a user to filter by year as well as product. The dataset is 7k rows and is loaded fully into the browser instead of using a paginated API.

###Getting Started###

```
	> cd redux-revenue-dashboard
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

###Feedback?###

I'm always looking to improve my code. Feel free to create an issue with any suggestions.
